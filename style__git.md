- **🚀 Build**: build project
- **🗑️ Delete / Remove**: delete something
- **📚 Docs**: documentation work
- **🧪 Experiment**: experiment that is not allocated to a separate git branch
- **🐞 Fix**: error correction

- **🚚 Move**: move files
- **♻️ Refactor**: refactoring code
- **✒️ Rename**: rename something to something

- **⚗️ Test**: for testing
- **⬆️ Update**: update files (eg from another project)
- **🔙 Revert**: revert the last commit
- **🚀 Publish**: publish the article

## Rules

All commits must start with the specified prefixes. Icons can change.

Do not end the subject line with a period.

Do not use articles. Explanations: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/7gjhpd/using_an_article_in_a_commit_message/) and [link](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/38759/dropping-articles-in-the-title-of-an-article-or-a-section-or-in-the-caption-o).

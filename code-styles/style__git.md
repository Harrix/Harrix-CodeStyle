# Git style

## Prefixes

The prefixes for the names of commits:

- **Add / Create**: something added
- **Build**: build project
- **Delete / Remove**: delete something
- **Docs**: documentation work
- **Experiment**: experiment that is not allocated to a separate git branch
- **Fix**: error correction
- **Modify**: any modification other than a fix
- **Move**: move files
- **Refactor**: refactoring code
- **Rename**: rename something to something
- **Replace**: replace something to something
- **Style**: fix formatting, correcting typos
- **Test**: for testing
- **Update**: update files (eg from another project)
- **Revert**: revert the last commit
- **Publish**: publish the article

## Rules

All commits must start with the specified prefixes.

Do not end the subject line with a period.

Do not use articles. Explanations: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/7gjhpd/using_an_article_in_a_commit_message/) and [link](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/38759/dropping-articles-in-the-title-of-an-article-or-a-section-or-in-the-caption-o).
